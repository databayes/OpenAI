This year, there were over 50,000 finishers, and with a race that size you often have logistical issues. But the 2024 Chicago Marathon was a smooth operation ‚Äì despite it‚Äôs size. There were ample volunteers at the expo, and I was able to breeze through the line to get my bib (although there was a long line to purchase merch). I arrived at the start about an hour before the gun, and I walked through security without an issue. My only logistical complaint is that my corral ‚Äì C ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt big enough to hold us all. When it was time for the corrals to ‚Äúclose,‚Äù there was still a large group of us waiting to get inside. But once the gun went off and corrals A and B started, we were able to file in. Unlike New York and Boston, you don‚Äôt have to worry about having a difficult time getting to the start. The start and finish are both downtown, and there are plenty of hotels within walking distance. I stayed just north of the river, about a mile away. The start time ‚Äì 7:30 (for the first wave) is also a good compromise. Not super early, but not late enough that you‚Äôll suffer through the afternoon. The course itself is great. It‚Äôs flat, and it offers a variety of settings and scenery. You weave in and out of downtown, out along the lake, and through several neighborhoods. The crowds were fantastic, and there was never a quiet moment. Some areas were thinner than others, but there were no dead spots. Although the course is congested early on, you can definitely PR on this course. It‚Äôs flat and fast, and after a couple miles you‚Äôre able to move around. As long as you‚Äôre seeded in the correct corral, you‚Äôll be carried along by the current. The one thing to be aware of is that the weather can be fickle ‚Äì it could be beautiful, it could be freezing, or it could be blazing hot. This year wasn‚Äôt bad (50‚Äôs into the 60‚Äôs), but it was hot two days before the race and cold and windy the day after. The post-race celebration was also nice. There was an assembly line of volunteers, pushing you through to get your medal, some hydration, and a foil blanket. They were also handing out free beer, although I heard that they ran out towards the later waves. Once you got out of the secure area, there was a big family reunion area along with another free beer (with a ticket) and food vendors. Chicago is also an amazing city ‚Äì between the architecture, the food, and the history. Take a long weekend, and enjoy the city before or after the race.
