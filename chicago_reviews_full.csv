This year was different because ran with part of my running gang and makes a very special ocassion.For my its the best Marathon experience of my 13 marathons in my life and always Chicago be an option to repeat it
"Great Race, Great City. No Headaches.","Mar 26, 2025|Marathon","The Chicago Marathon is one of Abbott World Marathon Majors – and typically the second largest race in the United States. This year, there were over 50,000 finishers, and with a race that size you often have logistical issues. But the 2024 Chicago Marathon was a smooth operation – despite it’s size. There were ample volunteers at the expo, and I was able to breeze through the line to get my bib (although there was a long line to purchase merch). I arrived at the start about an hour before the gun, and I walked through security without an issue. My only logistical complaint is that my corral – C – wasn’t big enough to hold us all. When it was time for the corrals to “close,” there was still a large group of us waiting to get inside. But once the gun went off and corrals A and B started, we were able to file in. Unlike New York and Boston, you don’t have to worry about having a difficult time getting to the start. The start and finish are both downtown, and there are plenty of hotels within walking distance. I stayed just north of the river, about a mile away. The start time – 7:30 (for the first wave) is also a good compromise. Not super early, but not late enough that you’ll suffer through the afternoon. The course itself is great. It’s flat, and it offers a variety of settings and scenery. You weave in and out of downtown, out along the lake, and through several neighborhoods. The crowds were fantastic, and there was never a quiet moment. Some areas were thinner than others, but there were no dead spots. Although the course is congested early on, you can definitely PR on this course. It’s flat and fast, and after a couple miles you’re able to move around. As long as you’re seeded in the correct corral, you’ll be carried along by the current. The one thing to be aware of is that the weather can be fickle – it could be beautiful, it could be freezing, or it could be blazing hot. This year wasn’t bad (50’s into the 60’s), but it was hot two days before the race and cold and windy the day after. The post-race celebration was also nice. There was an assembly line of volunteers, pushing you through to get your medal, some hydration, and a foil blanket. They were also handing out free beer, although I heard that they ran out towards the later waves. Once you got out of the secure area, there was a big family reunion area along with another free beer (with a ticket) and food vendors. Chicago is also an amazing city – between the architecture, the food, and the history. Take a long weekend, and enjoy the city before or after the race. Throughout the weekend, the place is teeming with runners, and it’s just one giant party. For now, I have other races to run. But I’m sure I’ll be back to Chicago at some point."
Major Marathon,"Dec 16, 2024|Marathon","I don’t know what my deal was this marathon. I was just not feeling it. Nerves, lack of sleep, weather. I don’t know. I just did not do well, and I felt sick for most of it. My son and I traveled to Chicago, and it was easy to maneuver around the city. Expo was HUGE and packed. Lots of goodies there to choose from for race swag. The course winded through a lot of neighborhoods, but I felt like it was a blur for me. Very well supported with fans lining the street. It is large and very well run I thought."
Great crowd support,"Nov 14, 2024|Marathon",The Chicago Marathon is like no other! The course is relatively flat with crowds cheering on every street. I ran with the Ronald McDonald House Charity team which made the race extra special!
The most FUN race I have ever run,"Nov 13, 2024|Marathon","This was my first major marathon and SO MUCH FUN!!I ran this as an “experience” race — I was trained well but didn’t go into it chasing a time, and I highly recommend doing this for Chicago. There is so much going on, the excitement etc is unmatched. ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE!The only downside is there was a severe lack of bathrooms on the course — there are 55k+ runners…. definitely could have used more portapotties."
"What do you say, it’s a world major","Nov 4, 2024|Marathon","Chicago is Chicago. A world major that provides a spectacular tour of the Windy City from Grant Park to Lake View, back down to Chinatown , etc. The course is packed with spectators creating an electric environment, and many sights to see. Aid is more than ample throughout the course. Most importantly, it is flat. Did I mention the course is flat? A world major that provides your best chance to BQ or PR is a must."
Second Major in the Second City,"Oct 27, 2024|Marathon","I scored this event with an overall rank of 5/5. This was my second marathon major and so I couldn’t help but compare my experience to last year’s 2023 NYC Marathon. Personally, I would give a *slight* edge to NYC overall, but I want to emphasize I truly loved this chance to run through Chicago. The flat course meant I was able to achieve a new personal best. In terms of scenery, running through the Loop is great and I liked being able to begin and end in Grant Park. There were a couple stretches where I felt the surrounding environment wasn’t as visually interesting and the crowds being as lively as I recall them being NYC, so I suppose there’s a trade-off with NYC having so many bridges but a vibrant course to make up for it. I paid extra to upgrade to the Skyline Hospitality Tent, and given how bad the bathroom lines were for the regular runner’s village, I am extremely glad I did so. I do lower my score for “Race Production” accordingly, since I think the experience of vast majority of runners who are not paying for expensive upgrades should be improved in the future. I was not really impressed by the designs of Nike’s official merchandise, and the fact they didn’t sell the finisher gear at the Expo is frankly ridiculous. I guess I took it for granted that New Balance didn’t do this nonsense in NYC. If given the opportunity, I would run in Chicago Marathon again. It is a great event and I would recommend to anyone. It’s a phenomenal chance to experience such a special city."
Amazing experience!,"Oct 24, 2024|Marathon","This was a race like no other. The crowd support, the city, the weather- it was an amazing first experience with a major. My only gripe is that despite start time being 8a we didn’t cross the start line until 8:22. This felt very unorganized. Otherwise, all was smooth sailing."
My new favorite marathon,"Oct 19, 2024|Marathon","Two things that I normally do for a marathon but did NOT do for this one: 1. I normally listen to music to keep my cadence up. The crowds were so loud that it would have been impossible to hear my anything in my headphones. That’s okay!! The crowds were what really made this my new favorite marathon. At the last minute, almost literally, I wrote my first name on a piece of duct tape and stuck it to my shirt. BEST decision ever! The spectators love to shout out name and it is so motivating. 2. I also normally run/walk (4 minutes run/1 minute walk. I did not do this initially, even though I had planned to. The adrenaline from the crowds carried be almost halfway before I started the run/walk. I even ran through the aid stations! My legs were not happy with me for waiting so long to give them a break. I tried to get in on lottery for my first Chicago Marathon, but I didn’t get in. Since I had a friend get in on legacy (she has run Chicago several times), it was an easy decision to run for a charity. I chose ALZ Stars (Alzheimer’s Association) and am so glad I did. I got a discounted rate at the Congress Plaza Hotel, which was right at the start/finish area. They provided a light breakfast the day of the race, along with a room to gather in pre-race. Overall, this was such a positive and amazing experience for me, I have already committed to fundraising for ALZ Stars for the 2025 Chicago Marathon, without even taking a chance on getting in on the lottery."
Chicago did not disappoint!,"Oct 17, 2024|Marathon","First time running Chicago and it was everything (except for my time) that I had hoped. Race day logistics and organization were great. Easy to find family at the finish and the starting waves appropriate to starting times for the most part. Tremendous crowds; may be blasphemous to say, but better than Boston! Humungous field but never felt boxed in. Course was easy as advertised, winding through the city. I preferred the downtown and the lake side winding back through Wrigleyville to the less picturesque miles 15-22 of the race, but the last few miles coming home were great. Expo was a disappointment – difficult to get to unless you take a bus or uber (no subway?) and Nike did not stock nearly enough non-apparel (e.g., hats/branded souvenirs). Race swag was just ok – t-shirt and a few random runner centric things – better swag at Boston or in many half marathons. All in all, a great race and glad to grab another Star."
Bucket List Marathon!,"Oct 17, 2024|Marathon","The Chicago Marathon has been on my bucket list since I started running marathons 10 years ago. What a great race! The race is huge, 52,000+ runners finished this year. Even with the large numbers, the organization was still top notch. I barely had to wait in line for my bib or shirt at the expo and I went during peak hours. Getting to the race was much easier than I thought. I walked from my hotel. I went to my corral at 7:30am for my 8am start time. No need for buses like at Boston and NYC marathons. The entire race is in Chicago so you see dozens of neighborhoods. The crowd support was solid, reportedly 1,000,000 spectators. I brought my own fuel, but didn’t need it. The course passes out gels regularly and bananas a few aid stations. I got plenty of food from spectators, mostly bananas and oranges, though there are plenty of options. The course is the flattest road race I have ever done. The finish line is well organized. You finish a walk a bit to get water and foil blankets. You keep walking and get lots of food and other drinks too, plenty for your post-face needs. Great experience overall!"
Chicago does it right!,"Oct 16, 2024|Marathon","Similarly as fast and fun as Berlin but more organized (expo, corrals, etc). This was my 2nd Chicago Marathon and am tempted to keep going back/running it back (if I can time qualify). Weather was near perfect. Crowd support is as good as it gets (but have not yet experienced NYC). Food (pre and post) in Chicago is on point (so many choices). CTA (trains) makes getting around the city a breeze (also to/from airport)."
Running in the Windy City With no wind,"Oct 14, 2024|Marathon","This was my 15th marathon and first major marathon. This was the most energetic marathon in regard to crowd support I have ran. Couldn’t have asked for better weather at 58 degrees at the start line, with cloud coverage and gentle wind throughout. There were only a few areas past mile 18 on that had no spectators. But other than that there were crowds on both sides. The expo was at Mccormick plaza, and was very large. Once there you had to go through security and show your QR code and I’d. Once entered you can then go to your designated number to get your bib. The expo had a lot of vendors, however very little freebies. The freebies were muscle milk, seltzer beer, and Gatorade electrolyte powder. There were plenty of photo ops, free poster and cowbell. Getting to the start line was easy to navigate. I arrived via ride share. I recommend getting dropped off at the Hilton on Michigan Ave if you choose this mode of transportation. I arrived at 7:10 and got to my corral well before the closing at 7:45 for wave 2. The waves started promptly on time. The first few miles were very congested as I couldn’t maintain my proper pace. I was even at the beginning of my wave and still couldn’t pass people. There were also areas throughout the race that got congested, and slower runners wouldn’t move over. There were 18 stations of water/electro, banana stations, chafing stations, and 2 gel energy stations. Plentyof aid stations, port a potties, and even a biofreeze station. The scenery was spectacular across the course. A lot of old architecture, and buildings to look at. I like how the organizers put carpet on the metal bridges. It didn’t however always cover the entire bridge. The spectators were so loud and energetic in a good way, which made it very motivating to climb through each mile. It felt like every time there was a turn, there was a great view of something amazing to greet you. The one thing that was frustrating about the marathon were non marathoners running on the course along with friends, and outside people crossing in front of you with bikes. On another note, the marathon is .35 further after the first mile and .16 throughout, making the total distance 26.61, and a .50 post race walk. Crossing the finish line felt very special. A lot of cameras so be prepared. Post race included aluminum water, Gatorade, the medal (which was quite a walk), the medal was meh. I expected it to be larger. I actually found the strap more appealing than the medal itself. There was a protein bar, banana, apples, rice crispy, stans donuts and muscle milk drink. If you are on the fence about running Chicago, don’t hesitate and sign up either by lottery or fundraising/charity"
"Great, great, great","Oct 14, 2024|Marathon",Don’t be intimidated by the sheer size of this event. Flawless race production from signup to banana. Definitely a bucket list run. Trains from the airport and loop service on Sunday are the way to go.
Bucket list race,"Apr 26, 2025|Marathon","My worst time ever in a marathon but the most fun. Truly excellent race. The crowds, the entertainment, the on course support was all fantastic."
Amazing race!,"Nov 13, 2024|Marathon",Such a fun race – so much spirit and encouragement at every step! Flat course that visits a lot of cool neighborhoods in Chicago. Very organized event!
Amazing crowds,"Sep 24, 2024|Marathon",From starting line to finish line there were people lining the streets. It was an amazing experience and a blast to run. Aid stations where very easy but did get slipper.
My favorite major (so far),"Jul 27, 2024|Marathon","A beautifully flat course that gives you a fun tour of chicago with TONS of crowd support. It was much like NYC marathon, but definitely a lot easier of a course, and less crowded. Would definitely run this one again."
Let's do it again,"May 5, 2024|Marathon","The Chicago Marathon: flat, fast, and iconic. With its vibrant cityscape backdrop and enthusiastic crowd support, it’s a runner’s dream come true. #ChicagoMarathon 🏙️"
Chicago Marathon!!,"Apr 18, 2024|Marathon","This was such an awesome experience. The energy of this race is so great. I feel like I didn’t need to run with music because I was so energized by the crowd and the runners around me. It’s a flat course, so great to shoot for a PR. It is important to note that it is a very crowded race the whole way through."
