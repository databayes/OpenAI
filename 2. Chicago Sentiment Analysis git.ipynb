This can help prevent unnecessary fatigue and strain on the legs during the race.\n9                   Improve the accessibility of the expo by providing more transportation options, such as a subway stop nearby or shuttle services from popular areas in the city. Additionally, increase the variety of merchandise available at the expo, particularly non-apparel items like hats and branded souvenirs, to enhance the overall experience for participants.\n10                                                                                                                                                     One actionable improvement could be to provide a greater variety of fuel options at aid stations throughout the race, in addition to gels and bananas, to cater to the different preferences and dietary needs of runners.\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Improve the organization and efficiency of the expo and corrals to enhance the overall experience for runners.\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Improve the size and design of the marathon finisher medal to make it more visually appealing and representative of the accomplishment of completing the race.\n13                                                                                                                     Create a guide or information packet for participants to help navigate the event and feel more prepared and less intimidated by its size. Include tips on transportation options like taking trains from the airport and utilizing loop service on Sunday.\n14                                                                                      One improvement could be to focus on improving your personal goal time for the next marathon while still enjoying the race atmosphere and support. This could involve setting specific training targets and strategies to help achieve a better time while still having a fun experience.\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Consider providing more water stations along the course to ensure participants stay hydrated throughout the race.\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Provide non-slip surfaces at aid stations to prevent slips and falls.\n17                                                                                                                                                                                 Increase communication and engagement with participants by encouraging more crowd support throughout the course and creating interactive experiences for runners to enjoy the tour of Chicago.\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Improve on the organization of water stations for smoother and more efficient hydration for runners.\n19                                                                                                  Consider exploring ways to manage and optimize the crowd flow during the race to ensure a smoother and less congested experience for participants.

No Headaches.","1":"Mar 26, 2025|Marathon","2":"The Chicago Marathon is one of Abbott World Marathon Majors – and typically the second largest race in the United States. This year, there were over 50,000 finishers, and with a race that size you often have logistical issues. But the 2024 Chicago Marathon was a smooth operation – despite it’s size. There were ample volunteers at the expo, and I was able to breeze through the line to get my bib (although there was a long line to purchase merch). I arrived at the start about an hour before the gun, and I walked through security without an issue. My only logistical complaint is that my corral – C – wasn’t big enough to hold us all. When it was time for the corrals to “close,” there was still a large group of us waiting to get inside. But once the gun went off and corrals A and B started, we were able to file in. Unlike New York and Boston, you don’t have to worry about having a difficult time getting to the start. The start and finish are both downtown, and there are plenty of hotels within walking distance. I stayed just north of the river, about a mile away. The start time – 7:30 (for the first wave) is also a good compromise. Not super early, but not late enough that you’ll suffer through the afternoon. The course itself is great. It’s flat, and it offers a variety of settings and scenery. You weave in and out of downtown, out along the lake, and through several neighborhoods. The crowds were fantastic, and there was never a quiet moment. Some areas were thinner than others, but there were no dead spots. Although the course is congested early on, you can definitely PR on this course. It’s flat and fast, and after a couple miles you’re able to move around. As long as you’re seeded in the correct corral, you’ll be carried along by the current. The one thing to be aware of is that the weather can be fickle – it could be beautiful, it could be freezing, or it could be blazing hot. This year wasn’t bad (50’s into the 60’s), but it was hot two days before the race and cold and windy the day after. The post-race celebration was also nice. There was an assembly line of volunteers, pushing you through to get your medal, some hydration, and a foil blanket. They were also handing out free beer, although I heard that they ran out towards the later waves. Once you got out of the secure area, there was a big family reunion area along with another free beer (with a ticket) and food vendors. Chicago is also an amazing city – between the architecture, the food, and the history. Take a long weekend, and enjoy the city before or after the race. Throughout the weekend, the place is teeming with runners, and it’s just one giant party. For now, I have other races to run. But I’m sure I’ll be back to Chicago at some point.","3":"2750","key":1,"index":1},{"0":"Major Marathon","1":"Dec 16, 2024|Marathon","2":"I don’t know what my deal was this marathon. I was just not feeling it. Nerves, lack of sleep, weather. I don’t know. I just did not do well, and I felt sick for most of it.

This was my second marathon major and so I couldn’t help but compare my experience to last year’s 2023 NYC Marathon. Personally, I would give a *slight* edge to NYC overall, but I want to emphasize I truly loved this chance to run through Chicago. The flat course meant I was able to achieve a new personal best. In terms of scenery, running through the Loop is great and I liked being able to begin and end in Grant Park. There were a couple stretches where I felt the surrounding environment wasn’t as visually interesting and the crowds being as lively as I recall them being NYC, so I suppose there’s a trade-off with NYC having so many bridges but a vibrant course to make up for it. I paid extra to upgrade to the Skyline Hospitality Tent, and given how bad the bathroom lines were for the regular runner’s village, I am extremely glad I did so. I do lower my score for “Race Production” accordingly, since I think the experience of vast majority of runners who are not paying for expensive upgrades should be improved in the future. I was not really impressed by the designs of Nike’s official merchandise, and the fact they didn’t sell the finisher gear at the Expo is frankly ridiculous. I guess I took it for granted that New Balance didn’t do this nonsense in NYC. If given the opportunity, I would run in Chicago Marathon again. It is a great event and I would recommend to anyone.

I barely had to wait in line for my bib or shirt at the expo and I went during peak hours. Getting to the race was much easier than I thought. I walked from my hotel. I went to my corral at 7:30am for my 8am start time. No need for buses like at Boston and NYC marathons. The entire race is in Chicago so you see dozens of neighborhoods. The crowd support was solid, reportedly 1,000,000 spectators. I brought my own fuel, but didn’t need it. The course passes out gels regularly and bananas a few aid stations. I got plenty of food from spectators, mostly bananas and oranges, though there are plenty of options. The course is the flattest road race I have ever done. The finish line is well organized.

This was the most energetic marathon in regard to crowd support I have ran. Couldn’t have asked for better weather at 58 degrees at the start line, with cloud coverage and gentle wind throughout. There were only a few areas past mile 18 on that had no spectators. But other than that there were crowds on both sides. The expo was at Mccormick plaza, and was very large. Once there you had to go through security and show your QR code and I’d. Once entered you can then go to your designated number to get your bib. The expo had a lot of vendors, however very little freebies. The freebies were muscle milk, seltzer beer, and Gatorade electrolyte powder. There were plenty of photo ops, free poster and cowbell. Getting to the start line was easy to navigate. I arrived via ride share. I recommend getting dropped off at the Hilton on Michigan Ave if you choose this mode of transportation. I arrived at 7:10 and got to my corral well before the closing at 7:45 for wave 2. The waves started promptly on time. The first few miles were very congested as I couldn’t maintain my proper pace. I was even at the beginning of my wave and still couldn’t pass people. There were also areas throughout the race that got congested, and slower runners wouldn’t move over. There were 18 stations of water/electro, banana stations, chafing stations, and 2 gel energy stations. Plentyof aid stations, port a potties, and even a biofreeze station. The scenery was spectacular across the course. A lot of old architecture, and buildings to look at. I like how the organizers put carpet on the metal bridges. It didn’t however always cover the entire bridge. The spectators were so loud and energetic in a good way, which made it very motivating to climb through each mile. It felt like every time there was a turn, there was a great view of something amazing to greet you. The one thing that was frustrating about the marathon were non marathoners running on the course along with friends, and outside people crossing in front of you with bikes. On another note, the marathon is .35 further after the first mile and .16 throughout, making the total distance 26.61, and a .50 post race walk. Crossing the finish line felt very special. A lot of cameras so be prepared. Post race included aluminum water, Gatorade, the medal (which was quite a walk), the medal was meh. I expected it to be larger. I actually found the strap more appealing than the medal itself. There was a protein bar, banana, apples, rice crispy, stans donuts and muscle milk drink.

No Headaches.","1":"Mar 26, 2025|Marathon","2":"The Chicago Marathon is one of Abbott World Marathon Majors – and typically the second largest race in the United States. This year, there were over 50,000 finishers, and with a race that size you often have logistical issues. But the 2024 Chicago Marathon was a smooth operation – despite it’s size. There were ample volunteers at the expo, and I was able to breeze through the line to get my bib (although there was a long line to purchase merch). I arrived at the start about an hour before the gun, and I walked through security without an issue. My only logistical complaint is that my corral – C – wasn’t big enough to hold us all. When it was time for the corrals to “close,” there was still a large group of us waiting to get inside. But once the gun went off and corrals A and B started, we were able to file in. Unlike New York and Boston, you don’t have to worry about having a difficult time getting to the start. The start and finish are both downtown, and there are plenty of hotels within walking distance. I stayed just north of the river, about a mile away. The start time – 7:30 (for the first wave) is also a good compromise. Not super early, but not late enough that you’ll suffer through the afternoon. The course itself is great. It’s flat, and it offers a variety of settings and scenery. You weave in and out of downtown, out along the lake, and through several neighborhoods. The crowds were fantastic, and there was never a quiet moment. Some areas were thinner than others, but there were no dead spots. Although the course is congested early on, you can definitely PR on this course. It’s flat and fast, and after a couple miles you’re able to move around. As long as you’re seeded in the correct corral, you’ll be carried along by the current. The one thing to be aware of is that the weather can be fickle – it could be beautiful, it could be freezing, or it could be blazing hot. This year wasn’t bad (50’s into the 60’s), but it was hot two days before the race and cold and windy the day after. The post-race celebration was also nice. There was an assembly line of volunteers, pushing you through to get your medal, some hydration, and a foil blanket. They were also handing out free beer, although I heard that they ran out towards the later waves. Once you got out of the secure area, there was a big family reunion area along with another free beer (with a ticket) and food vendors. Chicago is also an amazing city – between the architecture, the food, and the history. Take a long weekend, and enjoy the city before or after the race. Throughout the weekend, the place is teeming with runners, and it’s just one giant party. For now, I have other races to run. But I’m sure I’ll be back to Chicago at some point.","3":"2750","4":"The reviewer had a positive experience at the 2024 Chicago Marathon, noting that despite its large size, the race was well-organized.

I was even at the beginning of my wave and still couldn’t pass people. There were also areas throughout the race that got congested, and slower runners wouldn’t move over. There were 18 stations of water/electro, banana stations, chafing stations, and 2 gel energy stations. Plentyof aid stations, port a potties, and even a biofreeze station. The scenery was spectacular across the course. A lot of old architecture, and buildings to look at. I like how the organizers put carpet on the metal bridges. It didn’t however always cover the entire bridge. The spectators were so loud and energetic in a good way, which made it very motivating to climb through each mile. It felt like every time there was a turn, there was a great view of something amazing to greet you. The one thing that was frustrating about the marathon were non marathoners running on the course along with friends, and outside people crossing in front of you with bikes. On another note, the marathon is .35 further after the first mile and .16 throughout, making the total distance 26.61, and a .50 post race walk. Crossing the finish line felt very special. A lot of cameras so be prepared. Post race included aluminum water, Gatorade, the medal (which was quite a walk), the medal was meh. I expected it to be larger. I actually found the strap more appealing than the medal itself. There was a protein bar, banana, apples, rice crispy, stans donuts and muscle milk drink. If you are on the fence about running Chicago, don’t hesitate and sign up either by lottery or fundraising/charity","3":"2700","4":"The reviewer participated in their 15th marathon and found the Chicago Marathon to be the most energetic in terms of crowd support.

No Headaches.","1":"Mar 26, 2025|Marathon","2":"The Chicago Marathon is one of Abbott World Marathon Majors – and typically the second largest race in the United States. This year, there were over 50,000 finishers, and with a race that size you often have logistical issues. But the 2024 Chicago Marathon was a smooth operation – despite it’s size. There were ample volunteers at the expo, and I was able to breeze through the line to get my bib (although there was a long line to purchase merch). I arrived at the start about an hour before the gun, and I walked through security without an issue. My only logistical complaint is that my corral – C – wasn’t big enough to hold us all. When it was time for the corrals to “close,” there was still a large group of us waiting to get inside. But once the gun went off and corrals A and B started, we were able to file in. Unlike New York and Boston, you don’t have to worry about having a difficult time getting to the start. The start and finish are both downtown, and there are plenty of hotels within walking distance. I stayed just north of the river, about a mile away. The start time – 7:30 (for the first wave) is also a good compromise. Not super early, but not late enough that you’ll suffer through the afternoon. The course itself is great. It’s flat, and it offers a variety of settings and scenery. You weave in and out of downtown, out along the lake, and through several neighborhoods. The crowds were fantastic, and there was never a quiet moment. Some areas were thinner than others, but there were no dead spots. Although the course is congested early on, you can definitely PR on this course. It’s flat and fast, and after a couple miles you’re able to move around. As long as you’re seeded in the correct corral, you’ll be carried along by the current. The one thing to be aware of is that the weather can be fickle – it could be beautiful, it could be freezing, or it could be blazing hot. This year wasn’t bad (50’s into the 60’s), but it was hot two days before the race and cold and windy the day after. The post-race celebration was also nice. There was an assembly line of volunteers, pushing you through to get your medal, some hydration, and a foil blanket. They were also handing out free beer, although I heard that they ran out towards the later waves. Once you got out of the secure area, there was a big family reunion area along with another free beer (with a ticket) and food vendors. Chicago is also an amazing city – between the architecture, the food, and the history. Take a long weekend, and enjoy the city before or after the race. Throughout the weekend, the place is teeming with runners, and it’s just one giant party. For now, I have other races to run. But I’m sure I’ll be back to Chicago at some point.","3":"2750","4":"The reviewer had a positive experience at the 2024 Chicago Marathon, noting that despite its large size, the race was well-organized. They found the logistics smooth, particularly with ample volunteers at the expo and an easy start line entry. The course was praised for its flatness and variety of scenery, with strong crowd support throughout. The post-race celebration was also enjoyable, with volunteers efficiently distributing medals and hydration.

Overall, they had a great experience and would consider returning in the future.","5":"Positive","6":"Logistical issues at the expo","7":"One concise actionable improvement based on this review could be to ensure that there are enough volunteers and staff at each corral to allow for a smooth and timely entry for all participants, especially in larger corrals such as Corral C.

This was my second marathon major and so I couldn’t help but compare my experience to last year’s 2023 NYC Marathon. Personally, I would give a *slight* edge to NYC overall, but I want to emphasize I truly loved this chance to run through Chicago. The flat course meant I was able to achieve a new personal best. In terms of scenery, running through the Loop is great and I liked being able to begin and end in Grant Park. There were a couple stretches where I felt the surrounding environment wasn’t as visually interesting and the crowds being as lively as I recall them being NYC, so I suppose there’s a trade-off with NYC having so many bridges but a vibrant course to make up for it. I paid extra to upgrade to the Skyline Hospitality Tent, and given how bad the bathroom lines were for the regular runner’s village, I am extremely glad I did so. I do lower my score for “Race Production” accordingly, since I think the experience of vast majority of runners who are not paying for expensive upgrades should be improved in the future. I was not really impressed by the designs of Nike’s official merchandise, and the fact they didn’t sell the finisher gear at the Expo is frankly ridiculous. I guess I took it for granted that New Balance didn’t do this nonsense in NYC. If given the opportunity, I would run in Chicago Marathon again. It is a great event and I would recommend to anyone. It’s a phenomenal chance to experience such a special city.","3":"1502","4":"The reviewer gave the Chicago Marathon a 5/5 rating, noting that they slightly preferred the NYC Marathon but still loved running through Chicago.

I normally listen to music to keep my cadence up. The crowds were so loud that it would have been impossible to hear my anything in my headphones. That’s okay!! The crowds were what really made this my new favorite marathon. At the last minute, almost literally, I wrote my first name on a piece of duct tape and stuck it to my shirt. BEST decision ever! The spectators love to shout out name and it is so motivating. 2. I also normally run/walk (4 minutes run/1 minute walk. I did not do this initially, even though I had planned to. The adrenaline from the crowds carried be almost halfway before I started the run/walk. I even ran through the aid stations! My legs were not happy with me for waiting so long to give them a break. I tried to get in on lottery for my first Chicago Marathon, but I didn’t get in. Since I had a friend get in on legacy (she has run Chicago several times), it was an easy decision to run for a charity. I chose ALZ Stars (Alzheimer’s Association) and am so glad I did. I got a discounted rate at the Congress Plaza Hotel, which was right at the start/finish area. They provided a light breakfast the day of the race, along with a room to gather in pre-race.

I preferred the downtown and the lake side winding back through Wrigleyville to the less picturesque miles 15-22 of the race, but the last few miles coming home were great. Expo was a disappointment – difficult to get to unless you take a bus or uber (no subway?) and Nike did not stock nearly enough non-apparel (e.g., hats/branded souvenirs). Race swag was just ok – t-shirt and a few random runner centric things – better swag at Boston or in many half marathons.

I went to my corral at 7:30am for my 8am start time. No need for buses like at Boston and NYC marathons. The entire race is in Chicago so you see dozens of neighborhoods. The crowd support was solid, reportedly 1,000,000 spectators. I brought my own fuel, but didn’t need it. The course passes out gels regularly and bananas a few aid stations. I got plenty of food from spectators, mostly bananas and oranges, though there are plenty of options. The course is the flattest road race I have ever done. The finish line is well organized.
